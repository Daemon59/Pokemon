This is a practice project using EXCEL and MYSQL.

As someone who grew up watching Pokémon, I wanted to create a Pokémon database to learn and enjoy doing it.

This Project looks at Pokemon data to understand:

  Which Pokemon are the strongest.
  
  How many Pokemon are in each generation.
  
  How many types of Pokemon are there.
  
  How many Legendary Pokemon exit.
  
  Information about Pokemon.

There are around 800 Pokemon records
